# ML-Bias-Mitigation-with-Reweighing-Preprocessing

In this project, I implemented a preprocessing approach (reweighing) to mitjigate bias in ML model. Demographic biases is a matter of concern nowadays in the field of machine learning. Reweighing approach assigining more weight to the protected group to have the similar classification probabiltiy as privileged group.
